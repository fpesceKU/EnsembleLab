SIMULATION/ contains the results of the CALVADOS2 simulation of the provided sequence
- seq.fasta: user-provided IDP sequence
- env_settings.txt: user-chosen settings for MD (temperature, ionic strength, pH)
- top.pdb: pdb representative of the topology of the coarse-grained model
- traj.dcd: centered and PBC-solved trajectory of the coarse-grained MD simulation (visualization with ChimeraX is recommended)
- top_AA.pdb: pdb representative of the topology of the all-atom model
- traj_AA.dcd: centered and PBC-solved trajectory of the MD simulations converted to all-atom. NB: steric clashes might be present and interactions involving side-chains should not be trusted.
- traj.log: log file of the MD simulation
- observables.dat: ensemble averaged structural parameters calculated from the MD simulation, Dmax and scaling exponent (nu)
- hist_rg.dat: probability distribution function of the Rg from the MD simulation
- hist_rh.dat: probability distribution function of the Rh from the MD simulation
- hist_dee.dat: probability distribution function of the end-to-end distance from the MD simulation
- Rij.dat: scaling profile (average distance for each pair of residue |i-j| apart)
