SAXS/ contains the results of reweighting the CALVADOS2 simulation against SAXS data
- saxs.dat: Experimental SAXS intensities and calculated averaged SAXS profiles (both before and after reweighted); errors of experimental SAXS intensities are BIFT-corrected
- reweighted_observables.dat: SAXS-reweighted ensemble averaged structural parameters, Dmax and scaling exponent (nu)
- hist_rg.dat: SAXS-reweighted probability distribution function of the Rg from the MD simulation
- hist_rh.dat: SAXS-reweighted probability distribution function of the Rh from the MD simulation
- hist_dee.dat: SAXS-reweighted probability distribution function of the end-to-end distance from the MD simulation
- Rij.dat: SAXS-reweighted scaling profile (average distance for each pair of residue |i-j| apart)
